# Sicilian Mafia Network Distruption

Re-implementation and further exploration of the paper: "Disrupting Resilient Criminal Networks through Data Analysis: The case of Sicilian Mafia". The project offers two anonymized real-world datasets of the Sicilian Mafia: physical meetings and phone calls. 

The notebook contains a network exploration and techniques to disrupt the network by taking down specific nodes.

I wrote an article on this work on my personal blog: https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/sicilian/#
